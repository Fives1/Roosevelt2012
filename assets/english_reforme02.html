<h3>> Creation of a European corporate tax on profits</h3>

The average European profit tax rate is only 25&#37; compared
to 40&#37; in the USA<a href="#note1"><sup class="note">1</sup></a> . How ironic! The USA is considered
the most liberal country in the world -- but they apply
heavier corporate tax rates on profits!

Why does Europe practice such a low rate? Since I reland
and Great Britain joined the EU in 1 973, Member States
have been forced to lower their rates because of other
States lowering their taxes on profits to attract new
corporations. I reland reduced its tax rate to 1 2&#37; and all
other Member States had to reduce their own profit taxes. . .
At the European level, the average tax rate on profits has
come down one third in the last twenty years. This
converging towards the lowest common fiscal denominator
has been one of the main factors weighing on public debt.
<br/><br/>
<b>Profits have never been so high</b> (more than 550 billion
euros last year for the DJ Stox 600, alone<a href="#note1"><sup class="note">2</sup></a>), <b>but taxes on
profits have never been so low!</b>
<br/><br/>
The last time there was such a race downwards on standard
tax rates was in the USA <b>in the 1 920’s:</b> Texas was
reducing its taxes to attract corporations. Then Florida did
the same. Then Ohio. . .Corporations (and their stockholders)
shamelessly benefited from this fiscal dumping. Until the
1 929 stock market crash and subsequent economic
depression occurred. The individual states then realized
they had no money left in the public treasury whether to
help the unemployed or to stimulate the economy through
public spending!
<br/><br/>
As soon as he came to power, Roosevelt created a federal
tax on profits in order to put a stop to fiscal dumping among
neighbouring states. In Europe on the contrary, there is no
European 'federal' tax. This greatly encourages dumping
among neighbouring Member States. This is how Europe
has ended up with a tax rate inferior by 1 5 points to that of
the United States.
<br/><br/>
No country in the European Union can raise its profit tax
rate by 1 5 points: where it to do so alone, corporations
would quickly move to more fiscally advantageous
neighbouring states. However nothing prevents us from
acting on the European level by creating a European profits
tax of around 1 5&#37;.
<br/><br/>
<b>Financial leeway of 21 billion euros yearly for France</b><br/>
For the time being, Europe has no resources of its own. The
Member States contribute every year to the budget. This
year France will contribute 21 billion euros to the European
budget<a href="#note1"><sup class="note">3</sup></a>. I f the European budget were to be financed by a
European tax, these 21 billion would remain in the French
treasury and would reduce our deficit by the same amount. .
<br/><br/>
<b>What kind of European tax?</b><br/>
<b>A tax on corporate profits</b> should be created for the simple
reason that it is this very tax which has come down so
greatly over the last 20 years, benefiting shareholders far
more than investment. <b>An eco-tax</b> could also strengthen
Europe's own resources, while encouraging corporations to
reduce their energy consumption
<br/><br/>
The idea of creating a European tax had already been put
forward by Jacques Delors in the 1 980’s. After nearly 30
years of thinking about it, isn't it about time to act? Since a
new Treaty is to be negotiated before March 201 2, we must
insist it include the creation of a tax on financial transactions
and the creation of a European tax on corporate profits. I f
the European budget were financed by a European profit
tax, France would save a little more than 20 billion euros per
year. I f such a tax had previously existed, our public deficit
in 201 1 would have come to only 75 billion, less than 4&#37; of
GDP
