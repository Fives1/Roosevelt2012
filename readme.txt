This is a first version (0.1) of a 'Roosevelt2012 application'.
This application aims to allow each one to read the 15 Proposions of the 'Roosevelt Collectives' :
- without internet connexion
- in different languages, especially for Europeans and USA
- to establish a 'new deal' in economics rules (historically, year 2007 is like year 1930, ie 'the great depretion' !)

Originally, this Collectives is a French Collective, but aims and hope to be greater for the new deal !
Please for better comprehension, consult http://www.roosevelt2012.eu/

Don't hesitate to create application on other operating system.
